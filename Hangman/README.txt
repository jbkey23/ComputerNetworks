Please run the server on your local machine. We attempted to run it on the amazon instance, but it did not want to work.

As far as the android client is concerned, after losing or winning, the next time you try to play, the layout for the letter blanks may not show up, but if you let the game crash and try to play again, it will work fine.

Also, I tested the client with an emulator with screen size 5.1'', so if tested on a different screen size, the image views may not show up correctly. I did not go much into different screen densities since this is just a prototype.
